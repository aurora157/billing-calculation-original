# Current Task Status

## Current Objectives
- Converted Flask application to Django framework
- Maintained comprehensive data processing for both service breakdown and usage data
- Successfully generating formatted Excel output with all charge calculations
- Enhanced user-friendly interface for file uploads and report generation
- Removed large Knight Frank usage file to reduce repository size

## Context
The project processes billing data from service breakdown and usage CSV files to create a comprehensive billing report. The implementation now includes full charge calculations including roaming charges and category-based charge mapping. The application has been converted from Flask to Django for improved scalability and maintainability.

## Current Implementation
- Django web application with elegant pink and dark blue theme
- Client selection from predefined list:
  - Islestarr
  - ConvaTec UK
  - ConvaTec iPad
  - ConvaTec US
  - Tysers
  - Knight Frank
  - Institute of Cancer Research
- Drag and drop file upload support for CSV files
- Client-specific file upload options:
  - ConvaTec UK: Service Breakdown files for "convatec Limited" and "convatec plc", plus "List of Services Report"
  - Tysers: Usage, Service Breakdown, and Data Usage Summary files
  - Other clients: Standard Usage and Service Breakdown files
- Asynchronous file processing with loading indicator
- Form state persistence until explicit reset
- Dynamic button management:
  - Generate Report and Reset Form always visible
  - Open Report appears after generation
  - Open Report removed on form reset
- Python backend processes both service breakdown and usage CSV files
- Maps and processes essential data:
  - Department (from Cost Centre)
  - User (from Name)
  - Number (from Service)
  - Fixed Charges
  - Usage-based charges
  - EU/RoW Daily Roaming charges
  - Category-mapped charges
- Implements comprehensive charge calculations:
  - Daily Rate Roaming
  - UK to Abroad charges
  - Roaming Data charges
  - Roaming Calls charges
  - Other charges
- Generates formatted Excel output with proper monetary formatting
- Tracks usage status with "No Usage" indicators
